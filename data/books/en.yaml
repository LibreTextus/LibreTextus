1: Diary entry by Neil P. Raymond dated November 17, 1957
2: I'm so bored.
3: Always this desolation in my life.
4: I've never had a little action in my life.
5: My grandfather experienced something.
6: I loved it when we went to my grandparents for coffee on Sunday after church and he told me his adventure stories from the gold digger era around 1860.
7: My father, on the other hand, is the biggest boredom.
8: He was never interested in grandfather's crooks.
9: He always said that crime should be combated with the courts and lawyers of our modern judicial system and not with revolvers and violence.
10: But that's so sleepy all the time just talking about crime.
11: I want to experience adventures outdoors, with weapons and violent crooks, I always wanted to, but it always meant that I should finally get these childish jokes out of my head and become something decent.
12: That's why I'm a banker now, a life cannot be far from arms and criminals and barriers.
13: I live in the city's rich quarter, where tax evasion is the most criminal thing that happens.
14: Believe me, it's just boring to be rich.
15: It almost always takes you to the madhouse, this fake smile from your neighbors, always with that stick in your ass.
16: Who wants life like this? And at work I mostly only meet people like that, such rich bastards who fill their pants because they have put their money into the wrong company and now need my advice.
17: I would like to advise such creatures not to increase their money by doing nothing, but by work.
18: But these walking money bags would never listen to me, because the belief that stock trading is something like stew cooking, you just throw everything you need together, in your case money and a company, throw the stove and eat tadaa or just more money.
19: But that's not how stock trading works.
20: You have to limit yourself to one profession, for example international import-export companies and have to deal with them every day in order to then predict their success or crash, legally.
21: With a little practice it's not complicated, but you need practice, so you should start small and not want to get involved with the big ones.
23: Exactly for these reasons, I don't like these arrogant full-time millionaires because they think of themselves that with the money they usually get from their parents, they could be used for anything, or even capable of anything, but why do these supposed geniuses need a cleaning lady if they sit around at home all day anyway?
24: My grandparents are completely different.
25: You worked hard for your wealth, you know what work means.
26: You can just hear this from the saying about cleaning women or gardeners, since my grandparents appreciate the service from their staff, pay them a decent salary and provide them with a room in the villa and do not subliminally imply that those people themselves are to blame have about their poverty and that they are incapable of anything.
27: My grandparents would never say or hint something like this, the staff at them are always happy and in a good mood they work without fear that they would immediately lose their jobs again.
28: That's what I call humanity.
29: I noticed this every Sunday, earlier, during my favorite story lesson.
30: How I loved this time.
31: I still remember how my grandfather told the story in which he fought alone with his gold digger buddy against a gang of crooks who had buttoned gold-rich soil from weaker gold knights.
32: But they shouldn't have messed with my grandfather.
33: He even had to take action against the sheriff from this area, who was smeared by this group of criminals.
34: Back then my grandfather and his buddy were famous and all the crooks were afraid of them.
35: If someone had problems, they turned to the two heroes of the Yukon.
36: And I will never forget the story of how my grandparents met.
37: This is the most beautiful adventure he has had, says my grandfather.
38: Back then my grandmother was a waitress in a restaurant in a small gold mining town.
39: My grandfather regularly went for a drink with his partner, but that evening my grandfather saw how a drunk old man molested his future wife.
40: A couple of shootings and chases later, my grandparents and grandfather's friend caught the organization.
41: My grandfather has always been my greatest hero, he has always inspired me and taught me morals and decency with his stories.
42: If it hadn't been mine, I would now be as uptight as my father, the public prosecutor, that sounds like sheer boredom and sores on my ass.
43: When I was little, my father used to take him to the office.
44: And since then I knew that I would never become a lawyer.
45: Well BÃ¤nker wasn't the better idea, actually boring right away.
46: But every time I hear on the radio about a murder or kidnapping or other criminal activity, my longing for an adventure drives me out into the darkest corners of the city to meet my adrenaline needs.
47: To date I've only watched the police do their job, but I want more, I need more.
