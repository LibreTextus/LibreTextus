# LibreTextus

## Dependencies

You need to install *cmake* *build-essential* and *gtkmm*
If your cmake is too old it will automaticly build the newest cmake from source and uses it instead. It wont affect your other cmake installation.

```
sudo apt cmake install libgtkmm-3.0-dev build-essential
```

## How to Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..
make

./LibreTextus
```
