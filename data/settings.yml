  Here are some search syntax hints:
  <i>WORD WORD2</i> will give you all verses with <i>WORD</i> or <i>WORD2</i> in it.
  <i>"WORD ANOTHER WORD"</i> this means you want exactly what is quoted
  To get specific verses or chapters use the standart notation like: <i>GEN 1, 1-10</i>
  <i>WORD@GEN 1</i> will give all <i>WORD</i> in <i>GEN 1</i>
